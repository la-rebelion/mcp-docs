# Quickstart: MCP, API-first

:::tip
Choose your onboarding path: cloud for instant access, on-premise for full control.
:::

## 1. Choose Deployment Mode

### Cloud (Recommended for Most Teams)
- **runMCP:** [Create an account](https://run.mcp.com.ai) to manage servers and orchestrate APIs. The community has created many public APIs you can use or you can create your own.
- **chatMCP:** [Create an account](https://chat.mcp.com.ai) to integrate agents and interact with APIs via chat. You have access to public APIs created by the community or connect your own.
- No installation required‚Äîjust sign up and start building.

### On-Premise (Advanced/Enterprise)
- Start HAPI Servers manually on your infrastructure.
- Use La Rebelion's bash scripts to set up local DNS (Caddy + API wrapper).
- Review prerequisites and ensure your team is ready for manual operations.

## 2. Explore Example Projects

- For cloud, [log in](https://run.mcp.com.ai) and follow the onboarding guides in the webapp.
- For on-premise:
  
  - Install the corresponding binary and start the servers.
  - Or download the release from [GitHub](https://github.com/la-rebelion/hapimcp/releases).

```sh
# Check available API Specs
hapi list
# Start the example project
hapi serve example --mcp --headless
``` 

## 3. Access the API

- Cloud: Use the provided dashboard and API docs.
- On-premise: you can either use the CLI or any MCP client (must support `HTTP` protocol):

  * Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/swagger](http://localhost:8080/swagger) to access the OpenAPI documentation or *test the APIs* in your browser.
  * Use any MCP client to connect to the server, such as [chatMCP](https://chat.mcp.com.ai), [MCP Inspector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/inspector), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or curl.

More detailed instructions to access and test the MCP tools are available in the [Hello World guide](./getting-started/hello-world.md).

:::caution[Remember üéóÔ∏è]
On-premise setup requires manual server start and DNS configuration. Use provided scripts for Caddy setup or BYO DNS.
:::

## Next Steps

- Edit the OpenAPI schema to add endpoints.
- Explore context and memory features in MCP.
- Deploy to production (see [Deployment Guide](./deployment/)).
