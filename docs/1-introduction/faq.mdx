# Frequently Asked Questions: MCP, OpenAPI, API-first

Find answers to common questions about MCP, OpenAPI, and API-first development. All this in the context of the HAPI Stack for Model Context Protocol (MCP).

---

### ❓What is an MCP server?

An **MCP server** is not a traditional server implementation. In the context of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a server is simply a reference to a set of **tools** that can be invoked by an AI agent. You don't need to build a backend — just expose the contract that describes what tools are available.

---

### ❓Do I need to implement my own MCP server?

**No.** You can generate the MCP contract dynamically from your existing API using tools like the **HAPI Server**. This eliminates the need to manually implement logic or wrap your backend in new infrastructure.

---

### ❓How is MCP different from OpenAPI or Swagger?

**OpenAPI (Swagger)** defines how machines talk to machines using HTTP protocols. **MCP**, on the other hand, defines how **AI agents talk to applications** using structured contracts over JSON-RPC. You can actually generate MCP contracts from OpenAPI specs — the two are complementary.

---

### ❓Can I convert my OpenAPI spec into an MCP contract?

Yes. You can convert OpenAPI to MCP using automated tools like **HAPI Server**, which transforms your existing Swagger files into tool definitions readable by LLMs.

---

### ❓What are MCP tools?

**MCP tools** are individual functions or operations that an AI agent can invoke. Each tool has a name, description, and JSON input schema — similar to an OpenAPI operation. For example, an endpoint like `GET /users` becomes a tool like `getUsers`.

---

### ❓What is the HAPI Server?

**HAPI Server** stands for Headless API. It reads OpenAPI specs and dynamically serves an MCP contract, making your backend instantly usable by AI agents without rewriting code.

---

### ❓What is runMCP?

**runMCP** is a lightweight gateway that manages multiple MCP servers (like HAPI instances). It acts as a routing layer between AI agents and your tools, similar to an API gateway but focused on MCP contracts.

---

### ❓How does chatMCP work?

**chatMCP** is the client interface that lets users (or LLMs) invoke MCP tools interactively — like having an AI assistant that knows how to call your backend via the MCP contract.

---

### ❓What's the benefit of contract-first MCP development?

This approach allows **faster integration**, **no backend duplication**, and **agent-readiness out of the box**. Instead of reinventing your stack for AI agents, you let them plug into what already exists — securely and scalably.
