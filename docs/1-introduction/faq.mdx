# **Frequently Asked Questions:** MCP, OpenAPI, API-first

Find answers to common questions about MCP, OpenAPI, and API-first development. All this in the context of the [HAPI Stack](/glossary#h) for Model Context Protocol (MCP).

---

### ❓What is an MCP server?

An **MCP server** is not a traditional server implementation. In the context of the HAPI Stack, an MCP server is simply *a reference to a set of **tools*** that can be invoked by an AI agent or MCP Client, i.e.: [chatMCP](https://chat.mcp.com.ai). You don't need to build a backend — just expose the contract that describes what tools are available.

---

### ❓Do I need to implement my own MCP server?

**No.** You can generate the MCP contract dynamically from your existing API using tools like the [HAPI Server](/components/hapi-server/). This means you don't need to manually implement logic or rewrite your backend — you simply run HAPI Server (or deploy via [runMCP](/components/runmcp)) to expose your API as [MCP tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts#overview).

---

### ❓How is MCP different from OpenAPI or Swagger?

**OpenAPI (Swagger)** defines how machines talk to machines using HTTP protocols. **MCP**, on the other hand, defines how **AI agents talk to applications** using structured contracts over JSON-RPC. You can actually generate MCP contracts from OpenAPI specs — the two are complementary.

---

### ❓Can I convert my OpenAPI spec into an MCP contract?

Yes. You can convert OpenAPI to MCP using automated tools like [HAPI Server](/components/hapi-server/), which transforms your existing Swagger files into tool definitions readable by LLMs.

---

### ❓What are MCP tools?

**MCP tools** are individual functions or operations that an AI agent can invoke. Each tool has a name, description, and JSON input schema — similar to an OpenAPI operation. For example, an endpoint like `GET /users` becomes a tool like `getUsers`. An MCP Client (like [chatMCP](/components/chatmcp)) can then call this tool to retrieve user data.

---

### ❓How does chatMCP work?

**chatMCP** is the client interface that lets users (or LLMs) invoke MCP tools interactively — like having an AI assistant that knows how to call your backend via the MCP contract.

---

### ❓What's the benefit of contract-first MCP development?

This approach allows **faster integration**, **no backend duplication**, and **agent-readiness out of the box**. Instead of reinventing your stack for AI agents, you let them plug into what already exists — securely and scalably.
