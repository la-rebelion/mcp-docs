:::tip
*HAPI MCP* enables API-first development with OpenAPI and structured context, boosting developer happiness.
:::

Welcome to the official documentation of the Headless API Stack for the **[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/overview) (MCP)**. Here you'll discover how MCP leverages OpenAPI and an API-first approach for modern, scalable systems.

- **API-first:** *Design* and document your API before writing code
- **OpenAPI-powered:** Use OpenAPI as the contract for all services, agents, and tools
- **Runtime Simplicity:** No custom MCP servers needed; existing APIs become MCP-ready with HAPI Servers 
- **Context-driven:** Enable memory, personalization, and orchestration across your stack
