:::caution
API-first design with OpenAPI and MCP reduces integration pain and future-proofs your stack.
:::

## Why Choose MCP?
- **Interoperability:** APIs and context models are standardized, making integration easy
- **Rapid iteration:** Update your OpenAPI spec and ship new features fast
- **Context management:** Built-in support for memory, personalization, and orchestration
- **Future-proof:** Avoid vendor lock-in and keep your stack adaptable

## Example: Integration Without MCP
> "We spent weeks integrating with a partner because their API docs were out of sync with the implementation. With MCP and OpenAPI, this pain disappears."

## Best Practices
- Always update your OpenAPI spec before making code changes
- Use context to enable smarter, more adaptive workflows
