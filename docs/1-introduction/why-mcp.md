# Why MCP? Why API-first and OpenAPI Matter

<!-- <JSONLD/> -->

:::info
API-first design and MCP reduces integration pain and future-proofs your stack.
:::

## Why Choose _Headless API_ for MCP?
- **Interoperability:** APIs and context models are standardized, making integration easy
- **Rapid iteration:** Update your OpenAPI spec and ship new features fast
- **Context management:** Built-in support for memory, personalization, and orchestration
- **Future-proof:** Build on widely adopted standards, ensuring compatibility with existing tools and ecosystems while avoiding reliance on proprietary solutions

## Example: Integration Without MCP
> "We spent time integrating with a partner because we had to build custom connectors. With MCP and OpenAPI, this pain disappears."

## Best Practices
- Always update your OpenAPI spec before making code changes, code to the spec, not the implementation
- Use context to enable smarter, more adaptive workflows
