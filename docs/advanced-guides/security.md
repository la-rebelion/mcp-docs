# MCP Security Guide

This guide provides an overview of security best practices for deploying Model Context Protocol (MCP) systems, particularly in OpenAPI and API-first environments. It covers common vulnerabilities, mitigation strategies, and resources for maintaining secure deployments.

## Common Vulnerabilities
- **Injection Attacks**: Malicious input that alters the execution of commands or queries.
- **Broken Authentication**: Insecure authentication mechanisms that allow unauthorized access.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Inadequate protection of sensitive information, such as API keys or personal data.
- **Security Misconfiguration**: Default settings or incomplete setups that leave systems vulnerable.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Unauthorized commands transmitted from a user that the web application trusts.
- **Insecure Deserialization**: Flaws in handling serialized data that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.
- **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**: Lack of proper logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.
- **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: Utilizing libraries or frameworks that have known security issues.
- **Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards**: Redirecting users to untrusted sites without validation.

## OWASP Top 10

A list of the most critical security risks to web applications, which includes risks like injection attacks, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, and more.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth2 or JWT, and ensure proper authorization checks are in place.
- **Data Encryption**: Use TLS/SSL to encrypt data in transit and consider encrypting sensitive data at rest.
- **Security Headers**: Implement security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options to protect against common attacks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limiting to APIs to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Enable detailed logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate potential issues.
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up to date and use tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in libraries and frameworks.
- **Secure Configuration**: Follow security best practices for configuring servers, databases, and applications. Disable unnecessary features and services.
- **User Education**: Educate users about security best practices, such as recognizing phishing attempts and using strong passwords.

## Zero Trust Policies

Zero Trust is a security model that assumes threats could be internal or external, and therefore, no user or system should be trusted by default. Key principles include:
- **Verify Identity**: Always verify the identity of users and devices before granting access.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Grant users and systems the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Micro-Segmentation**: Divide networks into smaller segments to limit lateral movement of attackers.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Continuously monitor user and system behavior to detect anomalies and potential threats.
- **Assume Breach**: Operate under the assumption that a breach could occur, and have incident response plans in place.
