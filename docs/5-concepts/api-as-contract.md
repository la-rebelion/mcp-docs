# API as Contract: MCP, OpenAPI, API-first

In API-first, MCP-powered systems, the API specification is the contract between all participantsâ€”clients, agents, servers, and tools.

## What Does "API as Contract" Mean?
- Your OpenAPI spec defines every endpoint, input, output, and error
- All code, documentation, and tests are generated from the spec
- Changes to the API are made by updating the contract first

:::tip
Contract-driven development reduces integration friction and enables safe, fast iteration across teams.

## Example: Contract Testing
```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
paths:
  /messages:
    post:
      summary: Send message
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Message'
      responses:
        '201':
          description: Message sent
```

## Best Practices
- Treat your OpenAPI spec as the single source of truth
- Automate contract testing and validation
- Communicate contract changes early and clearly
