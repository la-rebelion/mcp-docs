# Intent Routing: MCP, OpenAPI, API-first

Intent routing is a crucial aspect of building intelligent conversational systems. It allows the system to understand user or agent intents and route them to the appropriate API operations or workflows based on context and OpenAPI definitions.

Intent routing is the process of mapping user or agent intents to the correct API operation or workflow, using context and OpenAPI definitions.

## How Intent Routing Works
- Parse the user's intent (e.g., "book a flight")
- Match intent to an operationId in your OpenAPI spec
- Use context to fill in parameters and personalize the response

:::tip
Define clear operationIds and use OpenAPI tags to organize intents and workflows.
:::

## Example: Intent to Operation Mapping
```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
paths:
  /flights/book:
    post:
      operationId: bookFlight
      summary: Book a flight
```

## Best Practices
- Use descriptive operationIds for each intent
- Validate intent-to-operation mapping with tests
- Use context to disambiguate and personalize routing
