## **A**
### **API-first**: An approach to software development that prioritizes the design and implementation of APIs before building the underlying application logic.
### **Automated Orchestration**: The automated arrangement, coordination, and management of complex computer systems, middleware, and services.

## **C**
### **Context**: The information surrounding a user interaction, including user preferences, history, and environmental factors.
### **Contract**: A formal agreement that defines the expectations and responsibilities of different parties in a system, often used to ensure compliance and interoperability.

## **D**
### **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Empowers developers to build better software, faster, minimizing technical debt proactively.
### **Developer Happiness**: We take DevEx seriously. It's about the overall satisfaction and productivity of developers, often enhanced by tools and practices that streamline workflows and reduce friction. HAPI MCP is designed to boost developer happiness by providing a structured, API-first approach.

## **G**
### **gRPC**: A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework that uses HTTP/2 for transport and Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) as the interface definition language.

## **H**
### **Headless API Stack**: A software architecture that separates the backend services from the frontend presentation layer, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.

## **I**
### **IDL (Interface Definition Language)**: A specification language used to define APIs and data structures in a way that is independent of programming languages.

## **L**
### **LLM (Large Language Model)**: A type of AI model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text.

## **M**
### **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: "*A standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools*" (as per official [specs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro)). We see this as a *contract* that defines how interfaces should behave in AI-native systems, enabling more effective interactions between users and models.
### **Memory**: The ability of a system to retain information about past interactions, user preferences, and other relevant data to improve future interactions.

## **O**
### **OpenAPI**: A specification for building APIs, allowing developers to define endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.
### **Orchestration**: The automated arrangement, coordination, and management of complex computer systems, middleware, and services.

## **R**
### **RESTful**: An architectural style for designing networked applications, relying on stateless communication and standard HTTP methods.

## **S**
### **Session**: A temporary, unique interaction between a user and a system, often tied to a specific task or conversation.
### **Swagger**: A set of tools for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs, now part of the OpenAPI Initiative.

## **T**
### **Technical Debt**: The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
