# Chat Flow Design: ChatMCP, OpenAPI, API-first

Designing conversational flows in ChatMCP means orchestrating how users, agents, and context interact through structured APIs. By leveraging OpenAPI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), you can create scalable, maintainable, and context-aware chat systems.

## What is a Chat Flow?
A chat flow defines the sequence and logic of interactions between a user and one or more agents. In ChatMCP, this is modeled as a series of messages, context updates, and tool invocations—each step informed by the current context and API contract.

:::tip
**API-first chat flows** ensure your conversation logic is always in sync with your backend, thanks to OpenAPI schemas and MCP's context model.
:::

## Core Principles
- **Context-Driven:** Every message is processed with full awareness of the current session and context, as defined by MCP.
- **OpenAPI Integration:** All agent actions and tool calls are described and validated using OpenAPI specs.
- **Composable:** Flows can include direct chats, group chats, and agent-mediated conversations.
- **Memory and State:** ChatMCP manages persistent and ephemeral memory for each conversation, enabling continuity and personalization.

## How ChatMCP Implements Flows
ChatMCP's architecture (see `src/pages/Chat.tsx` and `src/contexts/ChatContext.tsx`) uses React context to manage chats, messages, and agent interactions. Each chat flow:
- Tracks participants and chat type (direct, group, agent)
- Manages message history and context state
- Handles tool and agent invocations via MCPService
- Supports authentication and retries for secure flows

### Example: Direct Chat Flow
```js
// Pseudocode for direct chat initialization
const chat = getOrCreateDirectChat(contactId, contactName);
addMessage(chat.id, { content: 'Hello!', senderId: 'user' });
sendAgentMessage(chat.id, 'What can you do?');
```

### Example: Group Chat Flow
```js
const group = createGroupChat('Project Team', ['user1', 'agent1', 'user2']);
addMessage(group.id, { content: 'Let\'s start our sprint!', senderId: 'user1' });
```

### Flow with Tool Invocation
When an agent needs to use a tool (e.g., fetch weather):
```js
sendAgentMessage(chat.id, 'What\'s the weather?');
// Agent invokes OpenAPI tool, responds with structured data
```

:::caution
Always validate tool inputs/outputs against your OpenAPI schema to prevent runtime errors.
:::

## Best Practices
- **Design your flows with OpenAPI first:** Define all possible agent actions and tool invocations in your OpenAPI spec.
- **Use MCP context for personalization:** Persist relevant context (e.g., user preferences) to enable smarter flows.
- **Handle authentication gracefully:** Use ChatMCP's built-in auth retry mechanism for secure tool calls.
- **Test with real agents and users:** Simulate realistic flows to catch edge cases early.

## You Don’t Need to Implement MCP Servers Yourself
> "You don’t need to implement your own MCP servers to benefit from the protocol. ChatMCP and HAPI provide reference implementations, so you can focus on designing your flows and context models, not infrastructure."
