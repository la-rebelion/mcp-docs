# RunMCP: Gateway, API-first, OpenAPI, and MCP

RunMCP is the gateway and orchestrator for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) stack. It enables API-first deployments, dynamic routing, and seamless integration of OpenAPI-powered services, making it easy to scale, secure, and extend your MCP-based architecture.

## What is RunMCP?
RunMCP is a lightweight, extensible gateway designed to:
- Route API requests to the correct MCP or HAPI server instance
- Manage gateway configuration and dynamic subdomain routing
- Support multi-tenancy and plugin-based extensibility
- Integrate tightly with OpenAPI for contract-driven deployments

:::tip
RunMCP enables zero-config onboarding for new servicesâ€”just register your OpenAPI spec and go live!
:::

## Core Features
- **API-first gateway:** All routing and orchestration is driven by OpenAPI specs
- **Dynamic configuration:** Easily add, remove, or update services via config or API
- **Scalable:** Supports horizontal scaling and high-availability
- **Plugin system:** Extend with custom plugins for auth, logging, monitoring, and more

## Example: Registering a New Service
```js
// Pseudocode for registering a new MCP service
gateway.registerService({
  name: 'chatmcp',
  openapi: require('./chatmcp-openapi.json'),
  url: 'https://chatmcp.run.mcp.com.ai'
});
```

:::caution
Always validate your OpenAPI specs before registering new services. Invalid schemas can break routing and orchestration.
