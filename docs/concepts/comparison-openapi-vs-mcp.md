OpenAPI and MCP are both essential for API-first, context-driven systemsâ€”but they serve different roles.

## OpenAPI: The API Contract
- Defines endpoints, schemas, security, and documentation
- Used for code generation, validation, and testing
- Focused on API structure and communication

## MCP: The Context Protocol
- Adds structured, portable context to APIs
- Enables memory, personalization, and orchestration across sessions and tools
- Focused on context, state, and interoperability

:::tip
Use OpenAPI for your API contract, and MCP for context management and orchestration.

| Feature              | OpenAPI           | MCP                           |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| API Contract         | Yes               | No (uses OpenAPI)             |
| Context Model        | Limited           | First-class, structured       |
| Interoperability     | High              | Very high (context portable)  |
| Memory/State         | No                | Yes                           |
| Orchestration        | Limited           | Built-in                      |
