# What is MCP? API-first, OpenAPI, Model Context Protocol

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a modern standard for building API-first, context-driven systems. MCP combines the power of OpenAPI with structured, portable context to enable scalable, interoperable, and developer-friendly applications.

## Key Principles
- **API-first:** Your OpenAPI schema is the contractâ€”every tool, agent, and service follows it
- **Context-driven:** Context is a first-class citizen, enabling personalization, memory, and stateful workflows
- **Interoperability:** MCP makes it easy to integrate services, agents, and tools across languages and platforms

:::tip
MCP is designed for teams who want to move fast, avoid lock-in, and deliver great developer and user experiences.

## How MCP Works
- Define your API and context structure in OpenAPI
- Use MCP-compliant servers (e.g., HAPI, RunMCP) to enforce contracts and manage context
- Connect agents, tools, and clients using the same protocol

## Example: MCP Context in OpenAPI
```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Context:
      type: object
      properties:
        userId:
          type: string
        preferences:
          type: object
          properties:
            language:
              type: string
            theme:
              type: string
```
