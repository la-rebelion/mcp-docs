## What is a Chat Flow?
A chat flow defines the sequence and logic of interactions between a user and one or more agents. In ChatMCP, this is modeled as a series of messages, context updates, and tool invocationsâ€”each step informed by the current context and API contract.

:::tip[**API-first chat flows**]
*API-first chat flows* ensure your conversation logic is always in sync with your backend, thanks to API contracts and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This allows for dynamic, context-aware interactions that can adapt to user needs and system capabilities.
:::

## Core Principles
- **Context-Driven:** Every message is processed with full awareness of the current session and context, as defined by MCP.
- **API Integration:** All agent actions and tool calls are described and validated using API specs (the contract).
- **Composable:** Flows can include direct chats, group chats, and agent-mediated conversations.
- **Memory and State:** ChatMCP manages persistent and ephemeral memory for each conversation, enabling continuity and personalization.

## How ChatMCP Implements Flows
ChatMCP's architecture (see `src/pages/Chat.tsx` and `src/contexts/ChatContext.tsx`) uses React context to manage chats, messages, and agent interactions. Each chat flow:
- Tracks participants and chat type (direct, group, agent)
- Manages message history and context state
- Handles tool and agent invocations via MCPService
- Supports authentication and retries for secure flows

### Example: Direct Chat Flow
```js
// Pseudocode for direct chat initialization
const chat = getOrCreateDirectChat(contactId, contactName);
addMessage(chat.id, { content: 'Hello!', senderId: 'user' });
sendAgentMessage(chat.id, 'What can you do?');
```

### Example: Group Chat Flow
```js
const group = createGroupChat('Project Team', ['user1', 'agent1', 'user2']);
addMessage(group.id, { content: 'Let\'s start our sprint!', senderId: 'user1' });
```

### Flow with Tool Invocation
When an agent needs to use a tool (e.g., fetch weather):
```js
sendAgentMessage(chat.id, 'What\'s the weather?');
// Agent invokes OpenAPI tool, responds with structured data
```

:::caution
Always validate tool inputs/outputs against your OpenAPI schema to prevent runtime errors.
:::

## Example Context Flow (pseudocode)
```ts
// User sends input
addMessage(chat.id, { content: 'Hello!', senderId: 'user' });
// Prompt is constructed from chat history
const prompt = buildPrompt(chat.history);
// Agent processes prompt, may invoke RAG or tools
const answer = agent.processPrompt(prompt);
// Agent may call tools via OpenAPI
const toolResult = agent.invokeTool('getWeather', { location: 'Berlin' });
// Answer is returned and stored in memory
addMessage(chat.id, { content: answer, senderId: 'agent' });
```

## Best Practices
- **Design your flows with OpenAPI first:** Define all possible agent actions and tool invocations in your OpenAPI spec.
- **Use MCP context for personalization:** Persist relevant context (e.g., user preferences) to enable smarter flows.
- **Handle authentication gracefully:** Use ChatMCP's built-in auth retry mechanism for secure tool calls.
- **Test with real agents and users:** Simulate realistic flows to catch edge cases early.
