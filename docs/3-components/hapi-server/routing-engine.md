# HAPI Server Routing Engine

WIP: This section is a work in progress and will be updated with more details soon.

---

The HAPI server's routing engine is a powerful component that manages API traffic, enabling advanced routing and orchestration for applications built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Routing:** The routing engine can dynamically route requests to the appropriate service or microservice based on the request context and metadata.
- **Context-Aware:** It leverages the MCP context to make routing decisions, ensuring that requests are handled by the most relevant service instance.
- **Traffic Management:** The routing engine includes features for load balancing, rate limiting, and request prioritization, allowing for fine-grained control over API traffic.
- **Multi-Tenancy Support:** It can handle multiple tenants by routing requests based on tenant-specific metadata, enabling a single HAPI server to serve multiple applications or clients.

## How It Works
The routing engine operates by analyzing incoming API requests and determining the best route based on predefined rules and the current context. It uses the OpenAPI specifications to understand the available endpoints and their parameters, allowing it to intelligently route requests to the appropriate handlers.
